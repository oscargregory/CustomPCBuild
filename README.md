# Custom PC Build + Office Renovation

---

## How It Started

After leaving my job in Oil and Gas to transition fully into tech, I committed to a year of saving to fund this new chapter in my life. Part of this budget was dedicated to creating an optimized office space and upgrading my PC setup. I knew if I was going to spend long hours building a career in tech, I’d need a workspace that was both functional and comfortable. My previous setup was in the “second bedroom” of my condo—a cramped room with a Murphy bed and a pull-down desk. The space was cluttered, small, and anything but inspiring.

## Removing the Murphy Bed

The first step was to remove the Murphy bed, which was taking up over 20 square feet of my “office” space and had never been used. The bed had cost about $2500 new, so I hoped to recoup some of that by selling it. After reaching out to a few contractors, I quickly learned that these beds are difficult (and potentially dangerous) to remove due to their loaded springs, and no one was willing to take on the job. So, I posted it on Facebook Marketplace for $1200, with a $200 discount if the buyer handled the removal.

Within hours, I found a buyer whose husband was a contractor and felt confident he could handle the job. After six hours of hard work, the bed was finally out. It was a relief to reclaim the space, but this was only the beginning of the challenges.

## Problem #1: Flooring Gap

With the Murphy bed gone, I discovered that the flooring beneath it hadn’t been completed; the engineered hardwood stopped where the bed had been installed. My first call was to the building manager, who informed me that a storage locker containing extra supplies for homeowners had been broken into a year ago, and all extra flooring had been stolen.

I then contacted the flooring manufacturer, only to find that the product was from a German company and was no longer stocked locally. After a week of searching for a similar match, I got lucky—a box of the exact flooring was found in the building manager’s storage. Problem solved!

## Flooring and Baseboards

Armed with some YouTube tutorials and DIY guidance, I was able to patch the concrete floor left in my office and install the missing flooring and baseboards, successfully transforming the space.

## Building the Accent Wall

To add some contrast to the all-white room, I wanted a dark oak slat wall behind my computer. This would create a visually appealing focal point and soften eye strain from long hours on the computer. I ordered dark oak wood slats from thewoodveneerhub.com and planned to integrate "cove lighting" behind the accent wall for added depth and ambiance.

Using wooden braces, I installed the slats with enough space to wrap LED lights behind them. My dad's advice—"measure twice, cut once"—echoed in my mind throughout the three-day project. The accent wall came together beautifully, and the lighting effect was perfect.

## Mounting Monitors and Cable Management

I wanted a minimalist setup, with as few visible cables as possible. Fortunately, the wooden braces I’d used for the accent wall created just enough space (about 3/4 inch) to route cables neatly behind the wall, achieving a “cordless” look.

For monitors, I chose the MSI 34" 1000R curved display as my primary screen. I’ve been a fan of ultrawides since my first 34" LG, but I wanted something with a refresh rate above 60Hz this time. The MSI’s slight curve helps reduce eye strain, especially during long sessions.

For a secondary display, I opted for the LG DualUp, which is essentially two stacked screens in one. This setup allows me to use the DualUp with my main PC and my MacBook Pro simultaneously, thanks to its dual-input capability. With Synergy software, I can use a single keyboard and mouse to control both systems seamlessly.

**Monitor Setup:**

- **Primary Monitor:** MSI 34" Ultrawide 1000R Curved 165Hz (3440 x 1440)
- **Secondary Monitor:** LG DualUp 28MQ750 Monitor 27.6" 16:18 (2560x2880)

## Computer Build

Selecting the PC components was a long but enjoyable process. I researched extensively and consulted with friends who are custom PC enthusiasts. I initially planned to use an NVIDIA 4060ti but decided to wait a week for NVIDIA’s release of the 4070 SUPER, which offered better performance and saved me nearly $400. The finalized build provided all the power and functionality I needed for my new tech journey.

**PC Specs:**

- **Motherboard:** GIGABYTE Z790 AORUS Elite AX Intel
- **CPU:** Intel Core i7-14700K 14th Gen 20-Core
- **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER Windforce OC 12GB
- **RAM:** CORSAIR Vengeance 32GB DDR5 (2x16GB)
- **Power Supply:** CORSAIR RM850e
- **SSD:** WD_BLACK SN850X 2TB
- **Cooling System:** NZXT 360mm AIO CPU Liquid Cooler (Black)
- **Case:** Fractal North ATX - Charcoal Black with Walnut Front + Dark Tinted Glass

## Building the Computer

Building the PC was relatively smooth, thanks to step-by-step guides and support from friends. The only minor issue occurred during the initial boot. Nothing appeared on the screen, and I quickly realized I needed to update my motherboard’s UEFI boot version. After loading the correct version onto a USB stick, the system booted perfectly.

## Final Thoughts

The transformation from a cluttered, cramped room into a personalized, functional tech workspace has been well worth the time and effort. Not only is it a testament to the journey I’m on in the tech industry, but it also serves as a dedicated space for productivity and creativity as I work toward my goals.
